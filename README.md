# sastgriper
A simple grep user interface for searching code which can be used for SAST.

Before you start reading this I want to make sure the whole project is based upon this grep command.

grep -irnE  “regexp” ./pathtoFolder. I haven’t done anything new or I m not even bragging. I m starting and posting this for feedbacks and features which are going to be added in the upcoming versions. Feel free to give any suggestions, feedback.
I have only added a user interface where you can click a button which is mentioning your desired file and a visual studio code’s window will be opened and the cursor will directly point to that line number. You can add a breakpoint directly to it in visual studio code.

# Requirements

1.Flask Must be installed.

2.Make sure you have visual studio code installed on your system and 'code' command for visual stdio code must be configured with your environment
